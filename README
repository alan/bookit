The app is web scrapper that extracts the free courts at my tennis club, and then sends me an email when new courts become available.

The code might be useful to someone to see how I have tied together an evented script, Redis, web scrapping and sending emails with Ruby. Don't expect to run it as I have anonymised my personal details of the club!

In the future I plan to create a Sinatra web app to display the current availability and have one-click bookings (the clubs website is slow and non-intuitive!)
